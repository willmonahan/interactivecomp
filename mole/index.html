			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>I wanted to keep my rendition of Whack-A-Mole simple but fun. I found my sprites for the hammer and the mole on <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project,</a> and other than those sprites I chose to keep my visual style very simple. My sounds come from the Mac OS built-in alert sounds.</p>
			<p>For the start and end-screens of my game, I wanted to have something a bit more fun than a normal button, so I created an additional mole that the user had to catch in order to start the game.</p>
			<p>Other than that, there's not much to say. I hope you enjoy playing my game! If you want to learn more about how the game works, check out the comments in the source code <a href="sketch.js">here.</a></p>
